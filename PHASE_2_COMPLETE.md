## 🎉 **Status: Ready for Phase 3 - API Controllers!**

The core Stripe Connect functionality is fully implemented. You can now:

1. **Create connected accounts** for promoters (individual/business)
2. **Onboard users** with Stripe's hosted experience
3. **Process payments** with automatic Connect routing
4. **Calculate platform fees** dynamically
5. **Handle complex payment flows** for different campaign types
6. **Support cross-border payments** (CA ↔ US)

**Next Decision**: Should we build the API controllers next, or would you prefer to test the services first with a specific campaign type?
