## Database Migration Recommendations

### 1. Add New Entities to TypeORM Configuration

Update `database.module.ts` to include all new entities:

```typescript
entities: [
  // ... existing entities ...
  CampaignAnalytics,
  PromoterPerformanceMetrics,
  AdvertiserAnalytics,
  PlatformMetrics,
  PaymentTransaction,
  StripeConnectAccount,
  PaymentMethod,
  CampaignBudgetAllocation,
  BillingPeriodSummary,
  FinancialAnalytics,
  PayoutSettings,
  Invoice,
];
```

### 2. Generate Database Migrations

Run the following commands to generate migrations:

```bash
npm run typeorm:generate-migration -- CreateAnalyticsEntities
npm run typeorm:generate-migration -- CreateFinancialEntities
npm run typeorm:run-migrations
```

### 3. Add Indexes for Performance

Consider adding database indexes for:

- Foreign key columns (userId, campaignId, etc.)
- Frequently queried date ranges (periodStart, periodEnd)
- Status columns for filtering
