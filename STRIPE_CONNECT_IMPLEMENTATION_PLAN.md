2. **Payment Intents Tracking** - Track all Stripe payment intents with Connect data
3. **Transfer Management** - For separate transfer flows
4. **Campaign Payment Configs** - Per-campaign payment flow settings
5. **Platform Fee Tracking** - Detailed fee calculation and tracking
6. **Webhook Event Logging** - For debugging and audit trails
7. **Business Profiles** - For business promoters requiring additional KYC

### Next Steps for Phase 1:

1. Run the new SQL migration file
2. Update your database initialization scripts
3. Verify all foreign key relationships

---

## Phase 7: Testing Strategy

### Testing Environment Setup:

1. **Stripe Test Mode Configuration**
2. **Test Connected Accounts** (US and Canadian)
3. **Mock Payment Scenarios**
4. **Webhook Testing with Stripe CLI**

### Test Cases:

- Individual promoter onboarding (US/CA)
- Business promoter onboarding (US/CA)
- All campaign payment flows
- Cross-border payment scenarios
- Fee calculation accuracy
- Webhook event handling
- Error scenarios and recovery

---

## Phase 8: Production Deployment

### Pre-Production Checklist:

- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Stripe webhook endpoints configured
- [ ] SSL certificates for webhook security
- [ ] Error monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Legal compliance verification (US/CA)

### Go-Live Steps:

1. Switch to Stripe live mode
2. Update webhook endpoints
3. Test with real bank accounts
4. Monitor initial transactions
5. Verify fee calculations in production

---

## Cross-Border Considerations

### Current Limitations:

- Canadian platforms may have restrictions on US connected accounts
- Direct charges not supported cross-border
- Currency conversion handling needed

### Recommended Approach:

1. **Single Platform Strategy:** Use destination charges for all scenarios
2. **Dual Platform Strategy:** Separate US/CA Stripe accounts (if needed)
3. **Currency Handling:** USD as primary, CAD conversion as needed

---

## Compliance and Legal

### Requirements by Region:

#### United States:

- 1099-K tax reporting for earnings >$600
- State-specific money transmission licenses
- KYC/AML compliance through Stripe

#### Canada:
