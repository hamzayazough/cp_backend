# Database Schema Use Cases Summary

## Application Overview

This database schema supports a **Campaign Platform** that connects two primary user types: **Advertisers** and **Promoters**. The platform facilitates performance-based marketing campaigns where advertisers pay promoters for various types of promotional work.

### Platform Purpose

The application serves as a marketplace where:

- **Advertisers** create campaigns with specific budgets and requirements
- **Promoters** (influencers, content creators, salespeople) complete promotional work
- **Payments flow** from advertisers to promoters based on performance metrics
- **Platform earns** fees from successful transactions

### Campaign Types & Payment Models

**1. Visibility Campaigns (Pay-per-View)**

- Advertisers set a rate per 100 views (e.g., $3 per 100 views) and maximum view count
- Multiple promoters can participate simultaneously
- Promoters are paid monthly for views generated (minimum $20 threshold)
- Example: $3/100 views Ã— 2,000 views = $60 earned for the promoter

**2. Consultant Campaigns (Project-based)**

- Advertisers set minimum and maximum budget range for consulting work
- Single promoter selected through application process
- Multiple payments allowed during campaign duration (within budget range)
- Immediate payment upon work completion/approval

**3. Seller Campaigns (Deliverable-based)**

- Similar to consultant but focused on tangible deliverables
- Budget range with milestone-based payments
- Work submissions and approval workflows
- Project timeline management

**4. Salesman Campaigns (Commission-based)**

- Promoters earn commission percentage on sales they generate
- Sales tracked via referral links or coupon codes
- Monthly commission payouts (minimum $20 threshold)
- Performance-based long-term relationships

### Key Business Rules

- **$20 Minimum Payout**: Earnings below $20 accumulate until threshold is met
- **Pre-funded Campaigns**: Advertisers must fund campaigns upfront
- **Budget Controls**: Spending cannot exceed allocated campaign budgets
- **Monthly Cycles**: Visibility and salesman earnings paid monthly
- **Immediate Payments**: Consultant/seller payments processed upon completion
