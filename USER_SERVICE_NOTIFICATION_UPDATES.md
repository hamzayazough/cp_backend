# UserService Notification Integration - Summary

## âœ… **What We've Updated**

### 1. **Enhanced UserService**

- Added notification entity repositories to the constructor
- Updated `completeUserSetup()` method to include notification initialization
- Updated `createBasicUser()` method to set up notification preferences
- Added two new private methods:

#### `initializeNotificationPreferences(userId: string)`

- Creates default notification preferences for new users
- Sets up sensible defaults for each notification type
- Prioritizes critical notifications (payments, security alerts)
- Configures campaign, messaging, and system notifications

#### `sendWelcomeNotification(userId: string, role: string)`

- Sends role-specific welcome notification to newly setup users
- Includes metadata about account type and setup completion
- Different messages for advertisers vs promoters

### 2. **New NotificationService**

Created a comprehensive notification service with methods for:

- Creating notifications with user preference handling
- Getting user notifications with pagination
- Calculating unread counts by category
- Marking notifications as read/clicked/dismissed
- Managing user notification preferences
- Helper methods for specific notification types (campaign, payment, message)
- Cleanup jobs for expired notifications

## ðŸŽ¯ **How It Works Now**

### User Account Creation Flow:

1. **Basic User Creation** (`createBasicUser`)
   - Creates user in database
   - **NEW**: Initializes default notification preferences
   - Returns user object

2. **Account Setup Completion** (`completeUserSetup`)
   - Updates user profile and role-specific details
   - **NEW**: Ensures notification preferences are set up
   - **NEW**: Sends welcome notification based on user role
   - Returns complete user object

### Default Notification Preferences:

- **Critical** (enabled by default): Payment notifications, security alerts
- **Important** (email + push): Campaign applications, work approvals, meeting reminders
- **Moderate** (push only): New messages, campaign changes
- **Optional** (in-app only): Feature announcements, non-critical updates

## ðŸ”„ **Integration Points**

The updated `completeUserSetup` method now:

1. âœ… Creates/updates user profile (existing functionality)
2. âœ… Creates/updates advertiser/promoter details (existing)
3. ðŸ†• **Initializes notification preferences**
4. ðŸ†• **Sends welcome notification**

This means when your frontend calls the completion endpoint, users will automatically:

- Get properly configured notification settings
- Receive their first notification welcoming them to the platform
- Be ready to receive future notifications based on their preferences

## ðŸ“± **Frontend Impact**

No breaking changes to your existing API! The method signature remains the same, but now it provides additional value:

- Users get notification preferences set up automatically
- Welcome notifications appear in their notification feed
- Ready for future notification features (real-time, email, SMS, push)

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

1. **Add NotificationService to your module imports**
2. **Create notification endpoints** for the frontend
3. **Integrate with campaign/payment events** to trigger notifications
4. **Add real-time WebSocket** for instant in-app notifications
5. **Implement email/SMS delivery** services

The foundation is now in place for a complete notification system!
